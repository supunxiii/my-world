        you're the best thing ever happened to me babe. you have lighten up my
        whole life with happiness. before you my life was dark and i was all
        alone. but i never cared about it. i never thought that anyone could
        ever change me from being sad. and the way i think about life. after you
        step into my life i realized what is happiness that i long forgotten.
        before you i was a perfect depiction of Dr. Stephen Strange who was
        struggling to heal the wound damage, but anyway went on with life. you
        my love healed me in ways i can't explain. it was no coincidence i came
        to APIIT, it was the universe lead me to you. i beleive so, my xie lian.
        my hinata. every minute, every second i spend with you is so amazing
        honey. everything i dreamt when i was a kid being in love; i find that
        ecstasy with you. in 2012, i promised my dearest mum that someday when i
        am with a girl i would love her the same way you do for me. i hope you
        can feel my love the way i intended you to feel. you're so precious to
        me i don't know how can i ever make you realize how much you mean to me
        baby. i know in our journey we had various ups and downs, but we managed
        to pass every one of it and come to the very point that we are in now. i
        am sorry for everytime i made you sad honey. i really am. no matter what
        i am always your ruu. please forgive your dear ruu. you're such a kind
        soul that should never be hurt by anyone or anything. i will always
        protect you in my arms my baby. i will always will be there till my last
        breath in this life. in the next life i will again find you and tell you "Hello Mandinee" once again. do you remember the very first time i
        called you from the top middle row in the auditorium and asked whats
        your program and that i am going to make a group for us and asked for your number
        and i gave you my phone to save it. THAT WAS THE GREATEST THING I HAVE
        DONE IN MY LIFE MY MANDINEE. and the same day when i got on-board to the bus i saw you and called you. i still remember how you gazed at me. as the time pass by we became the best of
        friends. we had long late night calls. my crush for you began to grow. i
        was sending songs to you as you said and praised that i have a great
        musical taste. but i was trying to tell you how i feel through the melody. i know my ways are a bit unorthodox. one day you asked me about my birthday and i only told you in all of our
        batch as you were special to me. later some day when i call you i called
        you "Hello My Love" it came out of nowhere but that was what i've been
        holding up inside my heart. the time when we were falling in love the island was in crisis but we talked about us and our dreams. remember, you said that you wanted to
        have six kids. funny, cause that's what i've been planning as well. we became so close, and in one night (MAY 23rd) i was trying to teach you russian slang. the first thing i teach you was "Я
        люблю вас". then you asked me "ruu, do you love me?". when i heard those
        words i was so happy like i was never happy for anything that much. and again it felt like an electrical shock. there was a sudden warmth in my skull and felt there's something stuck in my throat. but i realized this is my chance, so i said...
        said "yes, i do mandinee". then you said "are you so sure? can't it be a
        crush?". then i got a little scared and i was shy. i thought you don't
        feel like that way. but then you said i am your "Plan A". i was
        relieved. afterwards, i became your lover. we first went on our date to burger king on 23rd of june. nobody in our batch knew who your bf is. it was fun and i enjoyed our sneaky moves. on july 09th you tried to stop me from going to a protest, i realized how much you care for me. after 03 days later you had your 22nd birthday, i tried to make it special as i can. hope i succeeded in it. i made our first spotify playlist <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6TlOD4cGksGQzuxSaMSKSz?si=46a2a2f3949d44fe&pt=8589f840191d0cbe00007060b3cc12e5" target="_blank">mandi+ruu</a> containing all the VIS you had. we had to celebrate your birthday before 12th at kfc. i gave you a small silver quaver necklace which you hold so dear to this very day. that day you said "ruu, your dress is too much". of course my love it's so special for me so i had to be the best version of myself. after 10 days from your birthday, at the student activity room we had our first kiss. i still remember how you looked at me after the first kiss, then you came onto me and kissed me back. hugging me tightly with love. that was just the beginning of many kisses. as the time passed by we started having many movie nights. we stared each other while we watch the movie so that we can feel each other's emotions. when we were said to be grouped for assignments we managed to stay together, so we won't be apart even for a little bit. we learned many things from each other. sometimes we went out together with our friends saying it's for our assignments... those days;<i> i was living my life with you.</i> you showed my life happiness hunnyy. yes, you are the one who taught me i should spell hunny as this way. later in the vacation we had a small day-out to pinnawala zoo so that we can celebrate my birthday. who knew, that journey would seal our fates? our families got to know about each other. paved our way to meet each other's families. just as you said my love it went really well. we officially got blessings from both of our sides. on november 28th our love took the most matured step.
