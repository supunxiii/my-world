        you're the best thing ever happened to me babe. you have lighten up my
        whole life with happiness. before you my life was dark and i was all
        alone. but i never cared about it. i never thought that anyone could
        ever change me from being sad. and the way i think about life. after you
        step into my life i realized what is happiness that i long forgotten.
        before you i was a perfect depiction of Dr. Stephen Strange who was
        struggling to heal the wound damage, but anyway went on with life. you
        my love healed me in ways i can't explain. it was no coincidence i came
        to APIIT, it was the universe lead me to you. i beleive so, my xie lian.
        my hinata. every minute, every second i spend with you is so amazing
        honey. everything i dreamt when i was a kid being in love; i find that
        ecstasy with you. in 2012, i promised my dearest mum that someday when i
        am with a girl i would love her the same way you do for me. i hope you
        can feel my love the way i intended you to feel. you're so precious to
        me i don't know how can i ever make you realize how much you mean to me
        baby. i know in our journey we had various ups and downs, but we managed
        to pass every one of it and come to the very point that we are in now. i
        am sorry for everytime i made you sad honey. i really am. no matter what
        i am always your ruu. please forgive your dear ruu. you're such a kind
        soul that should never be hurt by anyone or anything. i will always
        protect you in my arms my baby. i will always will be there till my last
        breath in this life. in the next life i will again find you and tell you
        that "Hello Mandinee" once again. do you remember the very first time i
        called you from the top middle row in the auditorium and asked whats
        your program and that i am going to make a group for us and your number
        and gave you my phone to save it. THAT WAS THE GREATEST THING I HAVE
        DONE IN MY LIFE MY MANDINEE. as the time pass by we became the best of
        friends. we had long late night calls. my crush for you began to grow. i
        was sending songs to you as you said and praised i have a great musical
        taste. but i was trying to tell you how i feel from the songs. one day
        you asked me about my birthday and i only told you in all of our batch
        as you were special to me. and one day when i call you i called you
        "Hello My Love" it came out of nowhere but that was what i've been
        holding up inside my heart. that time the island was in crisis but we
        talked about us and our dreams. remember, you said that you wanted to
        have six kids. we became so close, and in one night (MAY 23rd) i was
        trying to teach you russian slang. the first thing i teach you was "Я
        люблю вас". then you asked me "ruu, do you love me?". when i heard those
        words i was so happy like i was never happy for anything that much. i
        said "yes, i do mandinee". then you said "are you so sure? can't it be a
        crush?". then i got a little scared and i was shy. i thought you don't
        feel like that way. but then you said i am your "Plan A". i was
        relieved. i hope all this time till this very day i was your Plan A. and
        that i made it clear that i will always be another Plan but a reality.
        "i am sorry" for one last time. i never intended to end this gift like
        this......
